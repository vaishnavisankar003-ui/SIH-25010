## Problem Title  
**SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers**  

## Problem Description  
**Domain:** Government of Punjab – Agriculture, FoodTech & Rural Development  

---

## Proposed Solution – GramSeva Agriculture  

### Detailed explanation of the proposed solution  
- Develop *GramSeva Agriculture*, a multilingual mobile app/chatbot for personalized crop advisory.  
- AI-based recommendations for soil health, fertilizer usage, pest control, and irrigation.  
- Real-time weather and market price updates.  
- Voice-enabled features for illiterate farmers.  
- Offline support for rural areas with poor internet connectivity.  

### How it addresses the problem  
- **Bridging Knowledge Gap:** Provides scientific, data-driven recommendations instead of guesswork.  
- **Localized Advisory:** Tailors suggestions based on soil type, crop history, and regional weather.  
- **Language & Literacy Support:** Multilingual + voice assistance ensures easy usability.  
- **Affordable Access:** Mobile-based solution is cost-effective compared to extension services.  
- **Real-time Updates:** Weather alerts, pest detection, and market prices for timely decisions.  
- **Sustainability:** Balanced fertilizer use and integrated pest management reduce chemical overuse.  

### Innovation and uniqueness of the solution  
- Multilingual & voice-enabled advisory using NLP for regional languages.  
- AI-powered pest/disease detection from uploaded crop images.  
- Offline functionality with SMS/IVR integration for rural areas.  
- End-to-end support: crop, fertilizer, weather, soil health, and market data in one platform.  
- Feedback loop for continuous system improvement.  
- Scalable and integrable with government schemes, agri-departments, and cooperatives.

## Technical Approach  

### Technologies to be used  
- **Programming Languages:** Python (AI/ML), Java/Kotlin (Android), Swift (iOS).  
- **Frameworks & Tools:** TensorFlow/PyTorch, OpenCV, Flask/Django/Node.js, React Native/Flutter.  
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL/MySQL, Firebase.  
- **Cloud & Hosting:** AWS/Azure/Google Cloud with APIs for weather, soil, and market prices.  
- **Additional Technologies:** NLP for voice support, IVR/SMS integration, GIS & remote sensing.  

### Methodology and process for implementation  
1. **Requirement Analysis** – Identify farmer needs, collect soil, weather, and market datasets.  
2. **System Design** – Simple multilingual UI, AI-powered backend, advisory workflows.  
3. **Development Phase** – Mobile app with text + voice, AI/ML model training, API integrations, offline support.  
4. **Testing & Validation** – Pilot with farmers, validate with agri-experts, refine with feedback.  
5. **Deployment** – Launch in select districts, provide farmer training with NGOs/agri-departments.  
6. **Monitoring & Continuous Improvement** – Collect farmer data, refine AI models, expand to more crops/languages.
